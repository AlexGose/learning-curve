# Learning Curves

## Introduction

This is a repository for plotting [learning curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve_(machine_learning) in Python.

A Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to plot a learning curve for an example [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) model is coming soon.  The learning curve is one where the x-axis represents training set size, not the more common number of training loop iterations.  Please open an issue if you know of any such publicly available examples, and I will list them here.

Brief background information on learning curves, resources, and related software will also appear here soon.  The repository will be updated frequently; so, please check back soon.

This project is new.  Rapid and dramatic changes are likely.  The repository may even be deleted at some point.  Use at your own risk.
